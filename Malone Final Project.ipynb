    "# Title: Effective Resistance Calculations with Julia\n",
    "## Author: Joe Malone\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Using effective resistance to calculate the connectivity of a graph is a [commonly studied topic](https://www.nas.ewi.tudelft.nl/people/Piet/papers/LAA_2011_EffectiveResistance.pdf) in graph theory. It's applications can be used in recommender systems or any research that desires to know how closely related two nodes of a graph are. One of the main focuses of research in effective resistance relies on calculating effective resistance quickly and efficiently. This amounts to solving a Laplacian system of equations quickly and efficiently. Daniel Spielman and Shang Hua-Teng have been able to break through what was the previously supposed limit for run time of effective resistance calculators. They developed a [nearly-linear time solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0310051) for linear systems based off of previous work in graph theory. Daniel Spielman has written a library that includes this solver among others in the Laplacians.jl library for Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Used:\n",
    "* [IPython](https://ipython.org/)\n",
    "* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)\n",
    "* [Laplacians](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will examine the efficacy of the Laplacians library in Julia to calculate effective resistance between nodes in large networks. It will explain the usage of the library and show how to run through the calculations on a simple example at first and will then generalize the methods to more complicated networks. The project will mine data from the citeulike dataset for larger networks and then compare the nearly-linear time system solver to the exact solver to see which is quicker and more accurate. The last part of the project will allow readers to try creating different graphs and using the solver to calculate effective resistance between nodes. The project is mostly focused on displaying some of the capabilities of Julia and the Laplacians library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Github Repository](https://github.com/joe-malone/MATH-725-final.git) for This Project\n",
    "* Note that to run the code, you will need to first run `Pkg.add(\"Laplacians\")`"

    "In the cells below, create a large graph with one of the [graph generators](http://danspielman.github.io/Laplacians.jl/latest/graphGenerators/index.html#generators) from the Laplacians library. Create an approximate solver and an exact solver and find the effective resistance between any two nodes. See which solver is more efficient for different types of graphs using the `@time` macro. Does this change based on the size of the graph? If you get lost, use the test above as an example."
